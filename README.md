# Git Assignment
In this assignment i have created several  branches where i am editing the same file index.html and adding a new line of code in each branch and merging in the master branch
## Some of the git commands used
- create a new branch and switch `git checkout -b branchA`
- Switch to master `git checkout master`
- Merge the changes `git merge branchA`
- rebase the changes `git rebase branchA`
- shows the commit history `git log`
- fetch changes from a remote repository into the current branch `git pull`
